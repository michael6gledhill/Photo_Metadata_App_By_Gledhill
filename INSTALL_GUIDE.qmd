# Introduction

This guide will walk you through installing the Photo Metadata Editor application on your Mac. We'll cover two methods:

1. **Automatic Installation** (Recommended) - One command does everything
2. **Manual Installation** - For those who want more control

Choose the method that works best for you!

---

# Method 1: Automatic Installation (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to install the app. One command handles everything automatically.

## Step 1: Open Terminal

:::{.callout-note}
The Terminal is a program that lets you type commands to your Mac.
:::

1. Press **Command (⌘) + Space** on your keyboard
2. This opens Spotlight Search (the search bar at the top of your screen)
3. Type: `terminal`
4. Press **Enter** when you see the Terminal app highlighted

![Opening Terminal with Spotlight](assets/terminal-spotlight.png){fig-alt="Spotlight search showing Terminal"}

You should now see a window with white or black text on a dark or light background. This is the Terminal!

## Step 2: Copy the Install Command

Copy this entire command (click the copy button in the top-right corner):

```bash
sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michael6gledhill/Photo_Metadata_App_By_Gledhill/main/Install.sh | bash
```

:::{.callout-tip}
## What does this command do?
- `curl` downloads the installation script from GitHub
- The script then installs everything automatically
:::

## Step 3: Paste and Run

1. Click in the Terminal window
2. Press **Command (⌘) + V** to paste the command
3. Press **Enter** to run it

## Step 4: Wait for Installation

You'll see messages like:
```
========================================
Photo Metadata Editor - Installation
========================================

Creating installation directory...
✓ Homebrew already installed
✓ Git already installed
✓ Python 3 already installed
Cloning repository...
Installing Python dependencies...
Building macOS application...
```

:::{.callout-important}
## First Time Installation
If this is your first time, the script may need to install:
- **Homebrew** (Mac's package manager) - You may need to enter your password
- **Git** (version control tool)
- **Python 3** (programming language)

This is normal and safe! Just follow any prompts that appear.
:::

## Step 5: Installation Complete!

When you see:
```
========================================
✓ Installation Complete!
========================================

You can now find 'Photo Metadata Editor' in your Applications folder.
```

The app is installed! You can now:

1. Close Terminal (press **Command (⌘) + Q**)
2. Open **Finder**
3. Go to **Applications**
4. Find **Photo Metadata Editor**
5. Double-click to open it!

:::{.callout-warning}
## First Launch Security Warning
The first time you open the app, macOS might say it's from an "unidentified developer."

**To fix this:**
1. Right-click (or Control-click) on the app
2. Click **Open**
3. Click **Open** again in the dialog that appears

You only need to do this once!
:::

---

# Method 2: Manual Installation

This method gives you more control over each step of the installation process.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- At least 500 MB of free disk space
- Administrator access to your Mac

## Step 1: Open Terminal

1. Press **Command (⌘) + Space**
2. Type: `terminal`
3. Press **Enter**

## Step 2: Install Homebrew (if needed)

Homebrew is a package manager that makes installing software easier.

**Check if you have it:**
```bash
brew --version
```

If you see a version number, skip to Step 3.

**If not, install it:**
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow the on-screen instructions. You may need to enter your Mac password.

## Step 3: Install Git and Python

**Install Git:**
```bash
brew install git
```

**Install Python 3:**
```bash
brew install python@3
```

**Verify installations:**
```bash
git --version
python3 --version
```

You should see version numbers for both.

## Step 4: Choose Your Installation Location

Decide where you want to download the app files. We recommend your home directory:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p App
cd App
```

:::{.callout-note}
## What these commands do:
- `cd ~` - Go to your home folder
- `mkdir -p App` - Create a folder called "App"
- `cd App` - Go into that folder
:::

## Step 5: Clone the Repository

**If this is your first time installing:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/michael6gledhill/Photo_Metadata_App_By_Gledhill.git
```

**If you already installed before and want to update:**
```bash
cd Photo_Metadata_App_By_Gledhill
git pull
```

## Step 6: Navigate to the Project

```bash
cd Photo_Metadata_App_By_Gledhill
```

You should now be inside the project folder.

## Step 7: Install Python Dependencies

First, upgrade pip (Python's package installer):
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then install the required packages:
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:
- **PySide6** - GUI framework
- **Pillow** - Image processing
- **piexif** - Metadata handling

## Step 8: Install py2app

py2app is the tool that converts Python scripts into Mac applications:

```bash
python3 -m pip install py2app
```

## Step 9: Build the Application

Now we'll build the actual .app file:

```bash
python3 setup.py py2app
```

:::{.callout-note}
## Build Time
This may take 2-5 minutes. You'll see lots of messages - this is normal!
:::

When complete, you'll see:
```
done running py2app
```

The app is now built in the `dist` folder!

## Step 10: Move to Applications Folder

**Remove old version (if exists):**
```bash
rm -rf "/Applications/Photo Metadata Editor.app"
```

**Copy the new version:**
```bash
cp -R "dist/Photo Metadata Editor.app" /Applications/
```

## Step 11: Launch the App

You can now:

**Option A - From Terminal:**
```bash
open "/Applications/Photo Metadata Editor.app"
```

**Option B - From Finder:**
1. Open **Finder**
2. Go to **Applications**
3. Find **Photo Metadata Editor**
4. Double-click to open

:::{.callout-warning}
## First Launch Security
If you get a security warning, right-click the app, choose **Open**, then click **Open** again.

# Troubleshooting

## Command Not Found Errors

If you get `command not found` errors:

**For brew:**
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

**For python3:**
```bash
brew install python@3
```

**For git:**
```bash
brew install git
```

## Permission Denied Errors

If you get permission errors during installation:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/App
```

Then try the installation again.

## Build Fails

If `python3 setup.py py2app` fails:

**Clean previous builds:**
```bash
rm -rf build dist
python3 setup.py py2app
```

**Check Python version:**
```bash
python3 --version
```

You need Python 3.8 or later.

## App Won't Open

**Error: "App is damaged"**

This happens with unsigned apps. Fix it:
```bash
xattr -cr "/Applications/Photo Metadata Editor.app"
```

**Error: "Unidentified developer"**

1. Right-click the app
2. Click **Open**
3. Click **Open** in the dialog

## Dependencies Not Found

If the app opens but says packages are missing:

```bash
cd ~/App/Photo_Metadata_App_By_Gledhill
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
python3 setup.py py2app
cp -R "dist/Photo Metadata Editor.app" /Applications/
```

---

# Updating the App

To get the latest version:

## Automatic Method

Just run the install command again:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michael6gledhill/Photo_Metadata_App_By_Gledhill/main/Install.sh | bash
```

## Manual Method

```bash
cd ~/App/Photo_Metadata_App_By_Gledhill
git pull
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
python3 setup.py py2app
rm -rf "/Applications/Photo Metadata Editor.app"
cp -R "dist/Photo Metadata Editor.app" /Applications/
```

---

# Uninstalling

To remove the app:

**Remove the application:**
```bash
rm -rf "/Applications/Photo Metadata Editor.app"
```

**Remove source files (optional):**
```bash
rm -rf ~/App/Photo_Metadata_App_By_Gledhill
```

**Remove all project files (optional):**
```bash
rm -rf ~/App
```
