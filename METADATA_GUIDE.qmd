# Introduction

Photo metadata is information embedded directly in your image files. This guide covers the two main metadata standards:

- **EXIF** (Exchangeable Image File Format) - Technical camera data and basic descriptions
- **XMP** (Extensible Metadata Platform) - Rich descriptive metadata by Adobe

Understanding these fields helps you properly document, organize, and protect your photographs.

# Best Practices

## 1. Be Consistent

Use the same format and terminology across all images:
- ✓ "New York City" (not "NYC", "New York, NY", "New York")
- ✓ "© 2025 Company Name" (consistent copyright format)
- ✓ Standardized keyword vocabulary

## 2. Be Thorough But Efficient

**Essential fields to always fill:**
- `Artist` / `dc:creator`
- `Copyright` / `dc:rights`
- `ImageDescription` / `dc:description`
- `dc:subject` (keywords)

**Fill when relevant:**
- Location fields (if location matters)
- Technical fields (already captured by camera)
- Headline/title (for important images)

## 3. Use Templates

Create metadata templates for recurring scenarios:
- Event photography template
- Product photography template
- Portrait session template
- Landscape template

## 4. Keywords Strategy

**Good keywords:**
- Specific and relevant
- Consistent terminology
- Mix of general and specific
- Include: location, event, people, subject matter

**Example keyword set:**
```json
["2025", "Atlanta", "Georgia", "meeting", "Board of Governors", 
 "CAP", "Command Council", "government", "leadership"]
```

## 5. Copyright Protection

Always include:
- Copyright symbol (©)
- Year
- Rights holder name
- Usage terms (if needed)

**Examples:**
- `© 2025 John Doe. All rights reserved.`
- `© 2025 Company Name. Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.`
- `© 2025 Photographer. For editorial use only.`

---

# Field Priority Guide

## Must Fill (Essential)

1. `Artist` / `dc:creator` - Who created it
2. `Copyright` / `dc:rights` - Legal protection
3. `ImageDescription` / `dc:description` - What it shows

## Should Fill (Important)

4. `dc:title` - Name/headline
5. `dc:subject` - Keywords for discovery
6. `DateTime` - When it was taken
7. `xmp:Rating` - Quality/importance rating

## Nice to Have (Optional)

8. Location fields - Where it was taken
9. `photoshop:Headline` - Brief caption
10. `photoshop:Credit` - Organization/agency
11. Technical fields - Usually auto-filled by camera

---

# Troubleshooting

## Metadata Not Saving

**Check:**
- File is not read-only
- You have write permissions
- File format supports metadata (JPEG, TIFF, PNG)
- Not trying to edit RAW files directly

## Metadata Not Displaying

**Check:**
- Correct field names (case-sensitive)
- Using proper XMP namespaces (`dc:`, `photoshop:`, `xmp:`)
- File hasn't been stripped of metadata
- Using compatible software

## Special Characters Issues

**Avoid:**
- Smart quotes (" ") - use straight quotes (" ")
- Special Unicode characters in critical fields
- Line breaks in single-line fields

**Safe to use:**
- Standard punctuation
- © symbol
- Accented characters (é, ñ, etc.)

---
