# Metadata

Metadata is information about your photos: who took them, when, where, copyright, keywords, etc.

This app edits two types of metadata:

## EXIF

Standard format embedded in camera photos. Includes:
- **Artist** - Photographer name
- **Copyright** - Copyright notice (e.g., "© 2025 Jane Doe")
- **ImageDescription** - What the photo shows
- **UserComment** - Additional notes
- **Software** - Editing software used

Example:
```
Artist: Jane Doe
Copyright: © 2025 Jane Doe
ImageDescription: Portrait session at studio
```

## XMP

Flexible format for additional metadata. Includes:
- **dc:creator** - Creator/photographer name
- **dc:keywords** - Searchable tags (comma-separated)
- **dc:description** - Detailed description
- **dc:subject** - Main subject
- **dc:rights** - Rights holder
- **photoshop:Headline** - Short title
- **photoshop:Credit** - Photo credit line
- **photoshop:Location** - Photo location
- **xmpRights:UsageTerms** - License type

Example:
```
dc:creator: Jane Doe
dc:keywords: portrait, studio, professional
dc:description: Professional portrait session, studio lighting
dc:subject: Portrait Photography
dc:rights: Jane Doe
```

## Using Templates

1. Select one or more photos
2. Choose a template from the **Template** dropdown
3. Click **Apply Template**
4. Metadata is added to all selected photos

## What is Merge Mode?

**Merge Mode** (checkbox in Options):
- ✅ Checked: Adds new metadata without removing existing data
- ❌ Unchecked: Replaces all metadata with template data

Use Merge Mode when photos already have keywords or copyright you want to keep.

## Supported Formats

- **JPEG** (.jpg, .jpeg) - Best for metadata
- **TIFF** (.tif, .tiff) - Professional quality
- **PNG** (.png) - Web-friendly
